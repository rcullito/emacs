## What is Here?

  - straight.el and use-package for a sane package story
  - slight tweaks on zenburn theme to get rid of all the red and replace it with shades of
    purple that are easier on the eyes
  - some elisp utils I wrote to simplify defining vanilla emacs keybindings, organizing
    multiple sractch buffers, and an indentation helper
  - A port of Paul Graham's Generalized Variables macros from Common Lisp to simplify variable assignment

Packages that are not already installed will be installed on the first emacs run by straight
